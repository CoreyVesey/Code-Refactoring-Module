# Challenge-1-Code-Refactoring
GT Bootcamp Challenge #1

## Description 

The challenge that Horiseon set out for us was to refactor their existing code to make the code more accessible to users and also improve the code without changing any of it's function. Our task was to refactor the HTML code to have more descriptive selectors and image descriptions for people using screen readers for example. We also needed to refactor the CSS code to consolidate selectors that had the same properties. Also, in the CSS we labeled the different groups of selectors to better organize the code for others to easily navigate the code in the future.

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's current appearence and functionality after refactoring:
